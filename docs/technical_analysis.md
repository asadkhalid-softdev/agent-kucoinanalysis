# Technical Analysis Methodology

This document explains the technical analysis methodology used by the KuCoin Spot Analysis Bot.

## Overview

The bot uses a combination of technical indicators to analyze market conditions and generate trading signals. The analysis is performed across multiple timeframes to provide a comprehensive view of the market.

## Technical Indicators

### Relative Strength Index (RSI)

The RSI is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements. It oscillates between 0 and 100 and is typically used to identify overbought or oversold conditions.

- **Default Parameters**: 14-period RSI
- **Overbought Level**: 70
- **Oversold Level**: 30
- **Signal Generation**:
  - RSI > 70: Bearish signal (potential overbought condition)
  - RSI < 30: Bullish signal (potential oversold condition)
  - RSI between 30-70: Neutral with slight bias based on position relative to midpoint (50)

### Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)

The MACD is a trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of a security's price.

- **Default Parameters**: 12-period fast EMA, 26-period slow EMA, 9-period signal line
- **Signal Generation**:
  - MACD line crosses above signal line: Bullish signal
  - MACD line crosses below signal line: Bearish signal
  - MACD histogram increasing: Strengthening trend
  - MACD histogram decreasing: Weakening trend

### Bollinger Bands

Bollinger Bands consist of a middle band (SMA) with two outer bands that are standard deviations away from the middle band.

- **Default Parameters**: 20-period SMA, 2 standard deviations
- **Signal Generation**:
  - Price near upper band: Potential overbought condition (bearish)
  - Price near lower band: Potential oversold condition (bullish)
  - Bandwidth expanding: Increasing volatility
  - Bandwidth contracting: Decreasing volatility

### Simple Moving Average (SMA)

The SMA calculates the average price over a specific time period.

- **Default Parameters**: 50-period and 200-period SMAs
- **Signal Generation**:
  - Price above SMA: Bullish bias
  - Price below SMA: Bearish bias
  - 50-period SMA crosses above 200-period SMA: Golden Cross (strongly bullish)
  - 50-period SMA crosses below 200-period SMA: Death Cross (strongly bearish)

### Exponential Moving Average (EMA)

The EMA gives more weight to recent prices, making it more responsive to new information.

- **Default Parameters**: 20-period EMA
- **Signal Generation**:
  - Price above EMA: Bullish bias
  - Price below EMA: Bearish bias
  - EMA slope increasing: Strengthening trend
  - EMA slope decreasing: Weakening trend

### On-Balance Volume (OBV)

OBV measures buying and selling pressure as a cumulative indicator that adds volume on up days and subtracts volume on down days.

- **Signal Generation**:
  - OBV increasing while price increasing: Confirming uptrend
  - OBV decreasing while price decreasing: Confirming downtrend
  - OBV and price divergence: Potential trend reversal

### Stochastic Oscillator

The Stochastic Oscillator is a momentum indicator comparing a particular closing price to a range of prices over a certain period of time.

- **Default Parameters**: 14-period %K, 3-period %D, 3-period smoothing
- **Overbought Level**: 80
- **Oversold Level**: 20
- **Signal Generation**:
  - %K crosses above %D: Bullish signal
  - %K crosses below %D: Bearish signal
  - Readings above 80: Overbought condition
  - Readings below 20: Oversold condition

### Average Directional Index (ADX)

The ADX measures the strength of a trend, regardless of its direction.

- **Default Parameters**: 14-period ADX
- **Signal Generation**:
  - ADX > 25: Strong trend
  - ADX < 20: Weak trend
  - +DI crosses above -DI: Bullish signal
  - +DI crosses below -DI: Bearish signal

### Fibonacci Retracement

Fibonacci Retracement identifies potential support and resistance levels based on the Fibonacci sequence.

- **Default Levels**: 0.236, 0.382, 0.5, 0.618, 0.786
- **Signal Generation**:
  - Price approaching key Fibonacci level: Potential reversal or continuation point
  - Price bouncing off level: Confirmation of level as support/resistance

## Sentiment Analysis

The bot combines signals from multiple indicators to generate an overall sentiment. Each indicator produces a signal with the following attributes:

- **Signal**: The direction (bullish, bearish, neutral)
- **Strength**: The intensity of the signal (0.0 to 1.0)

The sentiment analysis algorithm:

1. Weights each indicator based on its reliability and importance
2. Normalizes signals to a common scale
3. Calculates a weighted average sentiment score
4. Determines the overall sentiment (buy, sell, neutral) based on the score
5. Assigns a strength level (strong, moderate, weak, none) based on the magnitude of the score
6. Calculates a confidence value based on the agreement among indicators

## Multi-Timeframe Analysis

The bot analyzes multiple timeframes to provide a more comprehensive view:

- **15-minute**: Short-term price movements and immediate signals
- **1-hour**: Medium-term trend and primary analysis timeframe
- **4-hour**: Intermediate trend confirmation
- **1-day**: Long-term trend context

Signals from longer timeframes are given more weight in the final analysis.

## Backtesting Methodology

The bot includes backtesting capabilities to validate the effectiveness of the analysis:

1. Historical data is divided into analysis windows
2. For each window, the bot generates signals
3. These signals are compared with actual price movements in subsequent periods
4. Accuracy metrics are calculated for different market conditions
5. Parameters can be optimized based on backtesting results

## Optimization

The bot can optimize indicator parameters for specific symbols and market conditions:

1. Multiple parameter combinations are tested against historical data
2. Accuracy is measured for each combination
3. The best-performing parameters are selected
4. Optimization can be performed periodically to adapt to changing market conditions
